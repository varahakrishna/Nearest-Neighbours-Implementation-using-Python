# Nearest-Neighbours-Implementation-using-Python
Implemented nearest neighbors, Used Pearson's Correlation Coefficient to find out the relation between variables using Heat Map.
Correlation heatmaps are graphical representations of the strength of correlations between numerical data. Correlation plots are used to determine which variables are related to one another and how strong this relationship is.
